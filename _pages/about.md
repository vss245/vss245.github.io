Hi, I’m Veronika. I’m interested in data analysis, neuroscience, coding and art. I have a background in neuroscience and computer science, and I've done some academic work in the field of computational neuroscience.

In my spare time, I like to write about science, data projects and other things as well as make art and music. This website is still a work in progress and infrequently updated.
