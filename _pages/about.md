Hi, I’m Veronika. I’m interested in analyzing data, neuroscience, coding, machine learning and art.

I have a background in computational neuroscience: I did a BSc in Neuroscience and Computer Science at NYU, a [MSc](/projects/msc/) in Neural Systems and Computation at the University of Zürich and ETH Zürich, with some work experience in different neuroscience labs.

In my spare time, I like to write about [write about science and other stuff](/blog) as well as tinker with coding projects, make art and music. This website is still a work in progress.
