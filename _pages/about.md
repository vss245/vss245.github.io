Hi, I’m Veronika. I’m interested in analyzing brain and other data, cognition, memory, mental disorders and coding. I am a neuroscience PhD student, currently researching [brain connectivity](/projects/phd/) at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience/Charité Berlin.

Previously, I did a Master's degree in Neural Systems and Computation at the University of Zürich and ETH Zürich. There, I wrote a [thesis](/projects/msc/) on oscillations in the amygdala and hippocampus during fear conditioning.

Before that, I did an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and computer science at New York University, together with some lab rotations that involved studying sleep in humans and examining affective biases in mice.

Outside of labs, I like to [write about neuroscience and other stuff](/blog) as well as make [art](/projects/gen/) and music.
