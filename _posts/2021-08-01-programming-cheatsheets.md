title: Programming cheatsheets
---

Since I have to switch or pick up programming languages occasionally and confusing features between them is getting pretty annoying, here are some small primers on basic syntax and features that I wrote to have a quick reference:

[Python](https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/Python-general.md) 

[R](https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/R.md)

A lot of Python and R’s power is in data science applications, so I’m currently writing a small sheet for this purpose specifically (ML libraries and visualization).

[MATLAB](https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/MATLAB.md) - I dislike it (some of the reasons very eloquently explained [here](https://neuroplausible.com/matlab)), but it’s ubiqutious in neuroscience and is a necessary evil.

[SQL](https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/SQL.md) - I’ve only gotten around to learning SQL queries, definitely more to add here.

Non-programming language but computer-related stuff:

[Shell](https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/Shell.md) - I don’t use the terminal much apart from file operations and Git, although I’ve seen some people do really impressive stuff with Makefile and I’m jealous.

[Git](https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/Git.md) - basic commands that I sometimes confuse, for an excellent and in-depth Git tutorial see [here](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/curious_intro.html).
