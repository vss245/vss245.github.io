title: Cool neuroscience articles, part 1
---

Reading an array of papers and essays that are outside of my current electrophysiology/connectivity/modeling bubble definitely takes away the time that I could spend feeling guilty about my code not working, but it’s still pretty fun. Here are some very good pieces of writing on three particular topics I’ve been pondering lately.

### Overpromising and overselling in science

- [“Promisomics and the Short-Circuiting of Mind” by Gomez-Marin, 2021](https://www.eneuro.org/content/8/2/ENEURO.0521-20.2021/tab-article-info) (see also: [this article on the Human Brain Project](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-human-brain-project-went-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/)) criticizes the popularity of “-omics” approaches to mapping the brain in hopes that more data leads to more understanding. More often than not, these maps ignore all the complexities that contribute to behavior and the mind (individual variability of connectomes, embodied actions, dynamical contributions of memory and experience), and, even worse, are built under faulty assumptions. “An infinite resolution map is not the territory”. 

- [“From Scientists to Salesmen”, an article by Jennifer Lee](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/vol24-2-dont-be-evil/from-scientists-to-salesmen/) (see also: [David Graeber on scientific output](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit)) highlights some of the worst current trends in science: increasing emphasis on self-promotion and marketing of your scientific “brand”, the profitability (both in money and scientific “clout”) of quick and flashy advances, competition between labs and the scramble for publications impeding genuine progress, as exemplified by the meteoric rise and fall of the Human Brain Project.

### Scientific revolutions and paradigms

- [“The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” by Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions) which has been gathering dust on my shelves for about 4 years, but hooray, the day has come. According to Kuhn, science is not a slow incremental process, but rather a process of establishing and then disrupting a scientific paradigm via a revolution (examples: Copernicus). Changing a paradigm involves discovering anomalies that can’t be accounted by current theories, but also needs the consensus of scientists and sometimes even precipitates rewriting scientific history. This book was occasionally panned for reminding people that scientists aren’t paragons of objectivity and can occasionally be human with all the resulting irrationality.
- [Havlík, 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2017.00007/full) describes intrinsic (or resting state) brain activity as a similar potential paradigm shift in our understanding of cognition.
- [Weiss and Shanteau, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34508955/) discuss the current reigning paradigm in decision making research and how it led to weak research in the field.
- [Chen et al, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.09.443246v2.full.pdf) talk about a potential paradigm shift in neuroimaging analysis and reporting of results.
- [Gomez-Marin and Ghazanfar, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627319307901) write about how “bodies aren’t just brain-holding vats that passively react to the environment”, “behavior isn’t just a stimulus-response operation” and “mice are not tiny humans”, single-handedly upsetting the entire cognitive neuroscience community.

### Design and visualization

- This is a much less heavy topic than “oof, science kind of sucks”, but is probably equally important. Awkward, cramped and hard to understand visualizations are the bread-and-butter of science, but it doesn’t have to be this way. The importance of good design also borders more serious issues, such as the inaccessibility of science.
- [Corell, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12975) discusses “bullshit visualizations” that, intentionally or not, muddle, obscure or straight up change the message of the data.
- [Crameri et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19160-7) talk about how colormaps can mislead the interpretation of data (TL;DR: don’t use the rainbow colormap!).
