  <td>Within science, I'm mainly interested in computational cognitive neuroscience as a tool for understanding cognition and how the brain does what it does. In my undergraduate degree at NYU, I did several research assistantships in cognitive neuroscience labs, doing things from setting up polysomnography equipment at people's houses at night to training a bunch of laboratory mice.<br><br>

  <td>In my Master's degree at UZH/ETH Zürich, I got access to a really cool clinical intracranial EEG dataset. I focused on theta and gamma oscillations (involved in learning and memory) and found that they might behave differenly in humans as compared to animals, which has implications for fear and anxiety research (subject to caveats and assumptions, of course). Some code from this project and my thesis is <a href="https://github.com/vss245/ieeg-code">here</a>.<br><br></td>

  <td>Currently, I am at Charité Berlin working on EEG and MEG connectivity in the resting state. Connectivity (statistical dependencies in signals between brain regions) may shed light on how brain circuits are organized and how things change in aging and disease.<br><br></td>
