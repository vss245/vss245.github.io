  <td>In research, I'm mainly interested in computational cognitive neuroscience (using mathematical models to understand how the brain learns and reasons). I did an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and computer science at NYU, where I did several research assistantships in cognitive neuroscience labs, doing things from setting up polysomnography equipment at people's houses at night to training a bunch of laboratory mice.<br><br>

  <td>In my Master's degree in Neural Systems and Computation at the University of Zürich and ETH Zürich, I got access to a really cool clinical intracranial EEG dataset. I focused on theta and gamma oscillations (involved in learning and memory) and found that they might behave differenly in humans as compared to animals, which has implications for fear and anxiety research (subject to caveats and assumptions, of course). Some code from this project and my thesis is <a href="https://github.com/vss245/ieeg-code">here</a>.<br><br></td>

  <td>Currently, I am at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience and Charité Berlin working on EEG and MEG connectivity in the resting state. Connectivity (statistical dependencies in signals between brain regions) may shed light on how brain circuits are organized and how things change in aging and disease.<br><br></td>
