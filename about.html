                    I attended <a href="https://neuromatchacademy.org">Neuromatch Academy</a> in summer of 2020, which was a very cool experience. I learned a lot about modeling, Bayesian statistics, reinforcement learning and deep learning within neuroscience. My group did a <a href="https://github.com/vss245/nma_code/"> short research project</a> on connectivity differences in mentalizing based on fMRI data.

                  Currently, I am working on EEG and MEG connectivity in the resting state. Connectivity (statistical dependencies in signals between brain regions) may shed light on the inherent organization of brain circuits and how things go awry in aging and disease.<br><br>

                    In my Master's thesis, I got access to a really cool clinical <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476542/">intracranial EEG</a> dataset. I focused on theta and gamma oscillations (involved in learning and memory) and found that they might behave differenly in humans as compared to animals, which has implications for fear and anxiety research (subject to caveats and assumptions, of course). Some of the MATLAB code from this project is <a href="https://github.com/vss245/ieeg-code">here</a>.

                    In my undergrad, I did several research assistantships in cognitive neuroscience labs, doing things from setting up polysomnography equipment at people's houses at night to taking care of and training a bunch of laboratory mice, in addition to learning the basics of biology, chemistry, physics, neuroscience, statistics and other fun stuff.
