  <td>Within science, I'm mainly interested in computational cognitive neuroscience as a tool for understanding cognition and how the brain does what it does. In my undergraduate degree at NYU, I did several research assistantships in cognitive neuroscience labs, doing things from setting up polysomnography equipment at people's houses at night to taking care and training a bunch of laboratory mice.<br><br>

  <td>In my Master's degree at UZH/ETH ZÃ¼rich, I got access to a really cool clinical intracranial EEG dataset. I focused on theta and gamma oscillations (involved in learning and memory) and found that they might behave differenly in humans as compared to animals, which has implications for fear and anxiety research (subject to caveats and assumptions, of course). Some of the MATLAB code from this project is <a href="https://github.com/vss245/ieeg-code">here</a>.<br><br></td>

  <td>Currently, I am working on EEG and MEG connectivity in the resting state. Connectivity (statistical dependencies in signals between brain regions) may shed light on the inherent organization of brain circuits and how things go awry in aging and disease.<br><br></td>

  <td>I attended <a href="https://neuromatchacademy.org">Neuromatch Academy</a> in summer of 2020, which was a very cool experience. I learned a lot about modeling, Bayesian statistics, reinforcement learning and deep learning within neuroscience. My group did a <a href="https://github.com/vss245/nma_code/"> short research project</a> on connectivity differences in mentalizing based on fMRI data.<br><br></td>

<td>I'm a big fan of learning new stuff. Currently, I am working on learning HTML/CSS for web design, SQL for data analysis and JavaScript for <a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/user/193657/?view=sketches#sketches">art and interactive visualizations</a>. I am also continuously working on improving my Python skills (it's my favorite language), mostly by doing <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/vss245/">Codewars</a> puzzles (slowly moving to LeetCode), although recently I've been figuring out Kaggle and other fun data science applications. <br><br></td>
