Iâ€™ve been learning JavaScript and some of its libraries to create small visualizations and games with code, such as various [cellular automata](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1170289), [random walkers](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/935248) and a very rudimentary [game of snake](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1250287). Work in progress, obviously :)
