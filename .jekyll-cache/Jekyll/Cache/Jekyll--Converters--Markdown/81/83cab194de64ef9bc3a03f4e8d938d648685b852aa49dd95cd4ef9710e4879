<p>Since I have to switch or pick up programming languages occasionally and confusing features between them is getting pretty annoying, here are some small primers on basic syntax and features that I wrote to have a quick reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/Python-general.md">Python</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/R.md">R</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/MATLAB.md">MATLAB</a> - I dislike it (some of the reasons very eloquently explained <a href="https://neuroplausible.com/matlab">here</a>), but it’s ubiqutious in neuroscience and is a necessary evil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/SQL.md">SQL</a> - I’ve only gotten around to learning SQL queries, definitely more to add here.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-programming-language-but-computer-related-stuff">Non-programming language but computer-related stuff:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/Shell.md">Shell</a> - I don’t use the terminal much apart from file operations and Git, although I’ve seen some people do really impressive stuff with Makefile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/vss245/programming-notes/blob/main/Git.md">Git</a> - basic commands that I sometimes confuse, for an excellent and in-depth Git tutorial see <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/curious_intro.html">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
