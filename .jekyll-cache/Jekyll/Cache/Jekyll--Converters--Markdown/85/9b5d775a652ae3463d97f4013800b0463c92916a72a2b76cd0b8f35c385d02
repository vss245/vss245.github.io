I"§<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Veronika. Iâ€™m interested in analyzing brain and other data, cognition, memory, mental disorders and coding. I am a neuroscience PhD student, currently researching <a href="/projects/phd/">brain connectivity</a> at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience/CharitÃ© Berlin.</p>

<p>Previously, I did a Masterâ€™s degree in Neural Systems and Computation at the University of ZÃ¼rich and ETH ZÃ¼rich. There, I wrote a <a href="/projects/msc/">thesis</a> on oscillations in the amygdala and hippocampus during fear conditioning.</p>

<p>Before that, I did an undergraduate degree in neuroscience and computer science at New York University, together with some lab rotations that involved studying sleep in humans and examining affective biases in mice.</p>

<p>Outside of labs, I like to <a href="/blog">write about neuroscience and other stuff</a> as well as make <a href="/projects/gen/">art</a> and music.</p>
