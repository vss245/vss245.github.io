    <td>I'm broadly interested in cognitive neuroscience and recently found myself gravitating towards computational cognitive neuroscience. In my undergrad, I did several research assistantships in cognitive neuroscience labs, doing things from setting up polysomnography equipment at people's houses at night to taking care and training a bunch of laboratory mice - as it turns out, mice are hard to train.<br><br></th>

    <td>In my Master's thesis, I got access to a really cool clinical <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476542/">intracranial EEG</a> dataset, which was recorded when people were recovering from electrode implantation surgery. Electrode implantation typically does not happen in humans, so it was an opportunity to directly examine activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during fear conditioning. I focused on theta and gamma oscillations, as they have mostly been found to be important to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095943881000005X">learning and memory</a> and found that, contrary to animal findings, theta oscillations in the amygdala decrease over multiple trials during fear conditioning (subject to caveats and assumptions, of course). I also did some connectivity investigations and modeling using the same dataset.<br><br></td>

    <td>Currently, I am working on EEG and MEG connectivity in the resting state. The resting state was often just considered to be "brain noise", until some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC14647/">seminal studies</a> discovered that there is interesting activity occuring there as well, and it might even tell us more about the inherent organization of the brain. Unfortunately, electrical signals aren't as well-behaved as blood flow, so there are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.20745">issues</a> with figuring out the "true" connectivity in those methods. Connectivity itself is also a somewhat <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03363">contested topic</a>, but I hope to contribute more to understanding it.<br><br></td>
