title: about me
---

I'm a computational neuroscientist by training - I'm passionate about neuroscience, particularly electrophysiology, and I've done some research work in the field in the past. For a rundown of my work experience, find me on LinkedIn.

I love books, especially sci-fi (my favorite is a toss-up between [Blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)) and [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel))). I have a lot of hobbies, which include, but are not limited to, painting, playing piano, learning languages (今はそれが日本語です), watching horror movies and extremely non-competitive running while listening to podcasts.

Education:\
2016 - BSc in Neuroscience (minor in CS) - New York University\
2019 - MSc in Neural Systems and Computation - ETH Zürich and the University of Zürich
